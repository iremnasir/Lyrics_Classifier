["I've told you once, now you should know\nThe reason that I'm coming down.\nThere ain't no time to repeat again;\nJust need to bring it around.", "We had a beautiful thing going,\nYou couldn't see things my way.\nWe had a beautiful thing going,\nSomething just got in our way.", "And I told you once that it was rough.\nI looked on you as my friend,\nBecause that did not seem to be good enough,\nAnd now it's time to begin.", "We've got a beautiful thing going,\nI hope that's the way it will stay.\nWe've got a beautiful thing going,\nNothing can stand in our way.", "Fourth Verse"]
