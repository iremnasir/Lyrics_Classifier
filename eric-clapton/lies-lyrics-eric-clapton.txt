["You told me this, you told me that\nYou try to tell me, tell me where it's at\nYou said you loved me, I can see through that\nLies, lies, lies", "You left me hangin', hangin' from a limb\nYou said you loved me, then you left with him\nLord, you did it to me, I see it in your eyes\nLies, lies, lies", "Tell me baby, why you take my time\nYou get a thrill off playing with my mind\nLord, you did it to me, I see it in your eyes\nLies, lies, lies"]
