["There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me\nAin't no breeze big enough to slow me\nI've never have seen a river that's too wide\nThere ain't no jail tight enough to lock me\nAin't no man big enough to stop me\nI'll be there if you ever want me by your side", "There ain't no rope stout enough to bind me\nLook for me, honey, you will find me\nAny old time, get ready with your charm", "I'll be there ready and a-waiting\nThere won't be any hesitating\nI'll be there if you ever want me in your arms", "Love me, if you're ever going to love me\nI've never have seen a road too rough to ride", "There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me\nAin't no breeze big enough to slow me\nI'll be there if you ever want me by your side", "Love me, if you're ever going to love me\nI've never have seen a road too rough to ride", "There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me\nAin't no breeze big enough to slow me\nI'll be there if you ever want me by your side"]
