["I'm looking for a girl who has no face\nShe has no name, or number\nAnd so I search within his lonely place\nKnowing that I won't find her", "Well, I can't stop this feeling deep in inside me\nRuling my mind\nI feel no sound\nDon't know where I'm bound", "The scenery is all the same to me\nNothing has changed or faded\nI'm a part of it, some part of me\nPainted cool green, and shaded", "So, try to find myself must be the only way\nTo feel free"]
