["Verse 1:\nCan you feel a wind blowing\nGot me talking to myself\nOne more day, one more truth, got to find out where\nFeel the blow of the river taking me there\nGood Lord only get you so far,\nThen you got to help yourself\nI don't need no reason, reason to hang my head", "Chorus:\nCause I gotta get over\nGet on over to the good side\nLord I gotta get over\nGet over, you get a lil' closer\nI gotta get over\nGetting closer to the good side\nGotta get over\nGetting over, over", "Verse 2:\nI've been breaking like the waves upon the sand\nYou know I need some fortitude, gonna keep it close at hand\nAnd I gotta shake it if I'm gonna break it on down the line\nAin't nobody can help me if I stay helpless all the time", "Chorus:\nI gotta get over\nGet on over to the good side\nGotta get over\nHelp me get a little closer\nI gotta get over\nGetting closer to the good side\nLord I gotta get over,\nGetting over, over"]
