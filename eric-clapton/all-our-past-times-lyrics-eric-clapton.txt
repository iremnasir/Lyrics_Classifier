["by Eric Clapton and Rick Danko", "I don't want to be the one to say I'm sorry.\nI don't want to be the one to take the blame.\nI don't want to be the one to throw it over.\nI don't want to be the one to feel ashamed.", "I don't want to be the one who thinks of nothing.\nI don't want to be the one to tell you what you have seen.\nAfter all this time, well I thought that you were mine.\nI just want to be the one who would share this dream.", "All our past times should be forgotten.\nAll our past times should be erased.\nI don't care how much it costs;\n'Cause I don't count the loss\nAs long as I can see your face again.", "You don't have to tell me when you're leaving,\nIf it's half past one, if it's maybe four.\nIt makes no difference where you think you're going,\nBut please remember not to slam the door.", "Chorus", "Yes, I don't care how much it costs;\nYou know I don't count the loss\nAs long as I can see your face again."]
