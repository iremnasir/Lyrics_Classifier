["Whippoorwill's singing\nSoft summer breeze\nMakes me think of my baby\nI left down in New Orleans\nI left down in New Orleans", "Magnolia, you sweet thing\nYou're driving me mad\nGot to get back to you, babe\nYou're the best I ever had\nYou're the best I ever had", "You whisper \"Good morning\"\nSo gently in my ear\nI'm coming home to you, babe\nI'll soon be there\nI'll soon be there", "Magnolia, you sweet thing\nYou're driving me mad\nGot to get back to you, babe\nYou're the best I ever had\nYou're the best I ever had\nYou're the best I ever had\nYou're the best I ever had\nYou're the best I ever had"]
