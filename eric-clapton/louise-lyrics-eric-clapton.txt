["Oh Louise, yes you're the sweetest girl I know.\nDon't you know now Louise, you are the sweetest girl that I know.\nYou made me run from Chicago\nOh, to the Gulf of Mexico.", "\nNow you know Louise,\nShe's like a rolling stone.\nEvery time she leave a man,\nHe has to grieve alone.", "\nOh Louise, why don't you hurry home?\nYou know, I never had no good loving,\nOh Louise, since you've been gone.", "\nGot a girl called Mamie,\nTreat me nice and kind.\nI don't care what she do\nBecause Louise is on my mind.", "\nChorus", "Louise ain't so good looking\nAnd her hair ain't red,\nBut she cooks my breakfast\nAnd I bring it to my bed.", "\nChorus", "Oh Louise, why don't you hurry home?\nOh Louise, why don't you hurry home?\nYou made me run from Chicago\nOh, to the Gulf of Mexico."]
