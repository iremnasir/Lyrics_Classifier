["by Jerry Lynn Williams", "God's got a plan, he's making it clear\nSweet little love song in your ear\nLike hearts made of diamond, love will prevail\nPut a little wind in your sail", "I'd do anything, anything you can dream of\nI'd do anything, anything for your love\nFor your love\nFor your love", "Listen now baby, I'll tell you true\nJust how much that I love you\nI got a sweet feelin' I know is real\nThis kind of love you can't conceal", "Chorus", "Chorus"]
