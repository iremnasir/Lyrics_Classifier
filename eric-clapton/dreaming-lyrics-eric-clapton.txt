["By jack bruce", "Dreaming about my love;\nYou bring me joy and happiness,\nMore or less.\nI dream my life away.", "Waiting for you to come;\nChanging my life for you to emptyness,\nMeaningless.\nMinutes just drift by.", "I don't care if I get nowhere.\nI can just dream and you'll be there.\nWhat else is there to do?", "Dreaming about my life;\nWhere are you now, and when will you\nCome to me?\nI dream my life away.", "Chorus", "First verse", "Dreaming, dreaming."]
