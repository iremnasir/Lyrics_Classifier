["Watch out now, take care\nBeware of falling swingers\nDropping all around you\nThe pain that often mingles\nIn your fingertips, beware of darkness\n(Beware of darkness)", "Watch out now, take care\nBeware of thoughts that linger\nWinding up inside your head\nThe hopelessness around you\nIn the dead of night", "Beware of sadness\nIt can hit you, it can hurt you\nMake you sore and what is more\nThat is not what you are here for", "Watch out now, take care\nBeware of soft shoe shufflers\nDancing down the sidewalks\nAs each unconscious sufferer\nWanders aimlessly\nBeware of Maya", "Watch out now, take care\nBeware of greedy leaders\nThey take you where you should not go\nWhile Weeping Atlas Cedars\nThey just want to grow, grow and grow\nBeware of darkness\n(Beware of darkness)"]
