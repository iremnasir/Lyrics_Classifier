["by Jerry Lynn Williams and Marty Grebb", "Well I just don't get it\nCan't make the pieces fit\nI might just as well forget it\nBut my heart won't let me quit", "You say it's only a part of love\nThat's right\nBut I get a little worried sometimes\nWhen I start to lose\nTired of holding it together\nWhen I know I'm going to blow another fuse", "I'm at my breaking point\nMy breaking point\nI'm at my breaking point\nMy breaking point", "Well you're never gonna get it\nIf you don't get up and try\nTry and spread those wings around me\nHoney let me see you fly", "You say it's only a part of love\nThat's right\nBut I get a little worried sometimes\nWhen I start to lose\nTired of holding it together\nWhen I know I'm going to blow another fuse", "Chorus", "Maybe someday you'll recover\nI can see it in your eyes\nOne more thing that you'll discover\nThat you'll finally realize"]
