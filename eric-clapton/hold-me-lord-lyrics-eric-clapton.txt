["Sixteen days in Bethlehem\nPeddling dope to keep drinking wine\nPulling women, making gigs\nSteerin' clear and doin' fine\nI moved on down to Galilee\nTrying to find a few new friends\nI'm throwin' aces everywhere\nTrying to forget the end", "So hold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I'm slippin' through\nHold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I beg of You", "I'm cruising through Jerusalem\nDust is flyin' everywhere\nI'm dodging bullets, making time\nOn the level, in the square", "They say you kissed your best friend's hand\nThey say you did it for his love\nThey say he got in agony\nThe hand fits well into the glove", "Woah, hold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I'm slippin' through\nHold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I beg of You", "Hold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I'm slippin' through\nHold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I beg of You", "Ohh, hold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I'm slippin' through\nHold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I beg of You", "Hold me Lord, oh hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I'm slippin' through\nHold me Lord, hold me Lord\nHold me tight, I beg of You"]
