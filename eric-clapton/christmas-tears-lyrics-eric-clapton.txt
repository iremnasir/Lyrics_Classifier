["I hear sleigh bells ring\nI haven't heard a word from you in years\nI hear sleigh bells ringin'\nBut I haven't heard a word from you in years\nI hear choirs singin'\nAnd I'm just sittin' here cryin' Christmas tears", "Everybody's singin' \"Merry Christmas\"\nAs they watch the starry sky filled with reindeer\nEverybody's singin' \"Merry Christmas\"\nAs they watch the starry sky filled with reindeer\nI'm smilin' on the outside\nBut on the inside I'm cryin' Christmas tears", "You been gone such a long, long time\nBut it's Christmas and I can't get you off of my mind\nSeems like you been gone a hundred years or more\nBut if you were here with me now\nI'd hang \"Merry Christmas\" on my door", "I need ya darling\nKiss and hold me tight\nI need ya darling\nOn a lonely Christmas night\nAnd as I sit and think of the lonely years\nI can't help but cry, oh, Christmas tears\nOh, Christmas tears"]
