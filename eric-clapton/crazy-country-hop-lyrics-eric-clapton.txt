["by J. Otis", "Way down in a country town one day\nA little ole' country band began to play.\nThey had two guitars and a beat-up saxophone;\nWhen the leader said go them cats began to blow.\nOoh wee oh oh, ooh la la\nLet's rock and roll.", "Now all the poeple gathered 'round\nJust to dig that rockin' rollin' sound.\nSuddenly the drummer rang a bell\nAnd all them country cats began to yell.\nOoh wee oh oh, ooh la la\nLet's rock and roll.", "Ole' MacDonald did a crazy bop\nSaid it's time to milk my cow, I got to stop,\nBut just before I cool it and cut out\nHere's something all you cats can think about.\nOoh wee oh oh, ooh la la\nLet's rock and roll.", "Snaggle-toothed Malinda was a drag,\nShe latched onto a dude who showed up stag.\nHe tried to run and then he tripped and fell;\nShe kissed him and we all could hear him yell.\nOoh wee oh oh, ooh la la\nLet's rock and roll.", "Well, a hound dog ran a polecat into town,\nBrought him to the dance and laid him down.\nSomeone hollered skunk and you can bet\nAll them country cats is runnin' yet.\nOoh wee oh oh, ooh la la\nLet's rock and roll."]
