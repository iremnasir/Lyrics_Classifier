["I saw you in a dream, it hit me like a bright light\nFlashing on a screen, visions of my whole life.\nI used to chase the moment of desire\nBack to when my young heart burned like a fire.", "It was just a, nothing but a grand illusion.\nHeart was quicker than the eye.\nNothing but a grand illusion,\nLegend in my own mind.", "I held you in my arms till the other side of midnight.\nKept you in my mind, you got me through some long nights.\nStanding on the threshold of desire,\nCaught between the madness and the fire.", "It was just a, nothing but a grand illusion.\nHeart was quicker than the eye.\nNothing but a grand illusion,\nLegend in my own mind.", "It was all a grand illusion.\nHand was quicker than the eye.\nNothing but a grand illusion,\nLegends in our own minds.", "I used to chase the moments of desire\nBack to when my young heart burned like a fire.", "It was just a, nothing but a, it was all a grand illusion.\nNothing but a grand illusion.\nIt was all a grand illusion,\nLegend in my own mind.", "It was just a grand illusion.\nNothing but a grand illusion.\nIt was just a grand illusion,\nLegends in our own minds."]
