["I am so in love for once in my life.\nIn my dreams, I've known you many times before.\nAnd I so want you to be my dear wife,\nAs only you can satisfy me any more,\nAnd only you can love me more.", "[Chorus:]\nI'm lovin' you lovin' me lovin' you.\nIt's all the same; when loving, two together makes one.\nEverybody sing la, la la la, la la la, la la la.\nIt's all the same, and we are one.", "I will give you a world of your dreams if you want them.\nI can feel the power when you're standing there.\nSomeone sent me you; oh lord, I will thank him,\nAnd all the rest, it just don't matter,\nAnd all the rest and all the rest.", "[Chorus]", "Loving you.\nYou know I love you."]
