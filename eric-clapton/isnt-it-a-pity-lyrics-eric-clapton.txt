["Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame\nHow we break each other's hearts\nAnd cause each other pain\nHow we take each other's love\nWithout thinking anymore\nForgetting to give back\nIsn't it a pity", "Somethings take so long, but how do I explain?\nWhen not too many people\nCan see we're all the same\nAnd because of all their tears\nTheir eyes can't hope to see\nThe beauty that surrounds them, oh\nIsn't it a pity", "(Rpt. 1st verse)", "Forgetting to give back\nIsn't it a pity\nForgetting to give back\nIsn't it a pity", "What a pity, it's a pity"]
