["In the lonely night,\nIn the stardust of a pale moonlight,\nI think of you in black and white\nWhen we were made of dreams.", "I walked alone through the shaky streets,\nListening to my heart beat\nIn the record-breaking heat\nWhen we were born in time.", "Just when I thought you were gone, you came back\nJust when I was ready to receive you.\nYou were smooth, you were rough,\nYou were more than enough.\nAh babe, why did I ever leave you\nOr believe you?", "In the rising curve,\nWhere the ways of nature will test every nerve,\nI took you close and got what I deserve\nWhen we were born in time.", "Just when I knew who to thank, you went blank\nJust as the firelight was gleaming.\nYou were snow, you were rain,\nYou were stripes and you were plain.\nOh babe, can it be you've been scheming\nOr was I dreaming?", "In the hills of mystery,\nIn the foggy web of destiny,\nYou're still so deep inside of me\nWhen we were born in time."]
