["by Dick Simms and Marcy Levy", "Last night as I stepped into the stage lights,\nI heard the people cry when they saw my face.\nThere's nothing like our hearts beating in time.\nThe crowd may inspire, but you give me my strength.", "Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry for your sweet smile.\nLonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I need to hold you for a while.", "I've been slipping into desperation;\nYou're the only salvation that the Lord designed.\nYour absence is controlling my defenses.\nMy life is senseless without you by my side.", "Chorus", "Chorus", "Loose ladies on the road will drive you crazy.\nEvery \"no\" becomes a \"maybe\", it never takes too long.\nMissing you, I don't know what I'm gonna do.\nYou don't know what I'm going through; everything seems wrong.", "Chorus"]
