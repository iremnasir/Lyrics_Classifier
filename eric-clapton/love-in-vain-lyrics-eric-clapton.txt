["(Robert Johnson)\nI followed her to the station with a suitcase in my hand\nAnd I followed her to the station with a suitcase in my hand\nWell it's hard to tell it's hard to tell, when all your love's in vain\nAll my love's in vain", "When the train rolled up to the station, I looked her in the eye\nWhen the train rolled up to the station, and I looked her in the eye\nWell I was lonesome I felt so lonesome, and I could not help but cry\nAll my love's in vain", "When the train it left the station, 't was two lights on behind\nWhen the train it left the station, 't was two lights on behind\nWell the blue light was my blues and the red light was my mind\nAll my love's in vain", "Ooh... [vocalized verse]\nAll my love's in vain"]
