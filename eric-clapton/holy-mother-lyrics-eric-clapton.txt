["Holy Mother, where are you?\nTonight I feel broken in two.\nI've seen the stars fall from the sky.\nHoly mother, can't keep from crying.", "Oh I need your help this time,\nGet me through this lonely night.\nTell me please which way to turn\nTo find myself again.", "Holy mother, hear my prayer,\nSomehow I know you're still there.\nSend me please some peace of mind;\nTake away this pain.", "I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.\nI can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you.", "Holy mother, hear my cry,\nI've cursed your name a thousand times.\nI've felt the anger running through my soul;\nAll I need is a hand to hold.", "Oh I feel the end has come,\nNo longer my legs will run.\nYou know I would rather be\nIn your arms tonight.", "When my hands no longer play,\nMy voice is still, I fade away.\nHoly mother, then I'll be\nLying in, safe within your arms."]
