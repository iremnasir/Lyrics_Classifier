["Little man with his eyes on fire and his smile so bright\nIn his hands are the toys you gave to fill his heart with delight\nAnd in the ring stands a circus clown holding up a knife\nWhat you see and what you will hear will last you for the rest of your life", "And it's sad, so sad, there ain't no easy way 'round\nAnd it's sad, so sad, all you friends gather 'round\n'Cause the circus left town", "Little man with his heart so pure and his love so fine\nStick with me and I'll ride with you till the end of the line\nHold my hand and I'll walk with you through the darkest night\nWhen I smile I'll be thinkin' of you and every little thing will be all right", "And it's sad, so sad, there ain't no easy way 'round\nAnd it's sad, so sad, all you friends gather 'round\n'Cause the circus left town", "And it's sad, so sad, there ain't no easy way 'round\nAnd it's sad, so sad, all you friends gather 'round\n'Cause the circus left town", "Circus left town, left town\nCircus left town, left town"]
