["If I could reach the stars, pull one down for you\nShine it on my heart, so you could see the truth\nThat this love I have inside is everything it seems\nBut for now I find, it's only in my dreams", "And I can change the world\nI will be the sunlight in your universe\nYou would think my love was really something good\nBaby if I could change the world", "If I could be king even for a day\nI'd take you as my queen\nI'd have it no other way\nAnd our love would rule this kingdom we had made", "'Til then I'd be a fool\nWishing for the day\nThat I can change the world\nI would be the sunlight in your universe", "You would think my love was really something good\nBaby if I could change the world\nBaby if I could change the world\nI could change the world", "I would be the sunlight in your universe\nYou would think my love was really something good\nBaby if I could change the world\nBaby if I could change the world\nBaby if I could change the world"]
