["Oh my word, what does it mean\nIs it love or is it me\nThat makes me change so suddenly\nLooking out, feeling free", "I sit here lying on my bed\nWondering what it was I'd said\nThat made me think I'd lost my head\nWhen I knew I'd lost my heart instead", "So won't you please read my signs, be a gypsy\nTell me what I hope to find deep within me\nBecause you can't find my mind, please be with me", "Of all the better things I've heard\nLoving you has made the words\nAnd all the rest seem so absurd\n'Cause in the end it all comes out, I'm sure", "Won't you please read my signs, be a gypsy\nTell me what I hope to find deep within me\nBecause you can't find my mind, please be with me"]
