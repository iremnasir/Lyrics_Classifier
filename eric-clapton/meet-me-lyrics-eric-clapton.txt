["Put it in your pocket, leave it in your shoe.\nPlug it in your socket, flush it down the loo.\nHey baby, show me something new.", "Put it in your hat, put it in your can.\nFeed it to your cat, share it with your band.\nHey baby, help me understand.", "Well they're fighting in the kitchen and they're fighting in the hall.\nUp against the dark and up against the wall.\nWhy don't you meet me in the bottom, baby; bring your running shoes."]
