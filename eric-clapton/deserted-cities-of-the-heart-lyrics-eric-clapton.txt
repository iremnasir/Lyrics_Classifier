["By jack bruce and pete brown", "Upon this street where time has died.\nThe golden treat you never tried.\nIn times of old, in days gone by.\nIf I could catch your dancing eye.", "It was on the way,\nOn the road to dreams, yeah.\nNow my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.", "The street is cold, it's trees are gone.\nThe story's told the dark has won.\nOnce we set sail to catch a star.\nWe had to fail, it was too far.", "Chorus", "I felt the wind shout like a drum.\nYou said, \"my friend, love's end has come.\"\nIt couldn't last, had to stop.\nYou drained it all to the last drop.", "Chorus", "Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.", "On this dark street the sun is black.\nThe winter life is coming back.\nOn this dark street it's cold inside.\nThere's no retreat from time that's died.", "It was on the way,\nOn the road to dreams, yeah.\nNow my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nNow my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah.\nNow my heart's drowned in no love."]
