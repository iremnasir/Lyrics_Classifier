["I never realized that you were in pain\nI wanna help you honey, let me see you again\nHurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough\nLife is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love", "Put a smile on your face and dry away your tears\nLife is bound to get better as you live your years\nHurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough\nLife is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love", "Somewhere in this world, the one you waited for\nCome along and find you, turn the key your door\nHurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough\nLife is so bad, baby, when you find the key to love"]
