["By ginger baker and mike taylor", "It is a cold winter,\nAway is the songbird.\nAnd gone is her traveller,\nShe waits at home.", "The sun is on holiday,\nNo leaves on the trees.\nThe animals sleep\nWhile cold north wind blows.", "The snowflakes are falling,\nThe roof a white blanket.\nThere's ice on the window pane,\nShe waits alone.", "She sits by the fireside,\nThe room is so warm.\nHer children are sleeping,\nShe waits in their home.", "Passing the time.\nPassing the time.\nEverything fine.\nPassing the time, drinking red wine.\nPassing the time, drinking red wine.\nPassing the time, drinking red wine.\nPassing the time, everything fine.\nPassing the time, drinking red wine.\nPassing the time, everything fine.\nPassing the time, wine and time rhyme.\nPassing the time.", "It is a long winter,\nAway is the summer.\nShe waits for her traveller\nSo far from home.", "She sits by the fireside,\nThe room is so warm.\nThere's ice on the window,\nShe's lonely alone."]
