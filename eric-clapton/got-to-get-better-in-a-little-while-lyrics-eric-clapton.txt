["Don't you know what's wrong with me?\nI'm seeing things I don't want to see.\nSniffing things that ain't no good for me.\nI'm going down fast, won't you say a prayer for me?", "It's got to get better in a little while.\nIt's got to get better in a little while.\nIt's got to get better in a little while.\nIt's got to get better in a little while.", "The sun's got to shine on my guitar someday.", "Revolution all across the land.", "\nJust like sly, you got to take a stand.\nPlease don't hurt nobody, don't knock them down;\nGive them a helping hand to get off the ground.", "Chorus", "The sun's got to shine on my guitar someday.", "Still one thing that you can do;\nFall down on your knees and pray.\nI know the lord's gonna answer you.\nDon't do it tomorrow, do it today.", "Chorus ad infinitum"]
