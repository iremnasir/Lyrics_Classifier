["by Eric Clapton", "It ain't no big deal, we're all lucky to be alive,\nI myself don't believe in luck, or taking chances, I will survive.\nEvery move I make, every twist every turn,\nYou scandalize and humble me, I may be slow but I will learn.", "'Cause I ain't going down anymore.\n'Cause I ain't going down anymore.\n'Cause I ain't going down anymore.\n'Cause I ain't going down anymore.", "If I had my way, I would probably just sit and stare.\nWatch the T. V. or read a book, I'd have no reason to be aware,\nBut I ain't got time, I just could not live that way.\nI've got to step outside myself, I've still got something left to say.", "Chorus", "Chorus", "Channelled in my groove, part of another space and time.\nPlease allow me to introduce another good friend of mine.\nSome call him fear, some call him righteousness.\nI myself ain't clear, and you can't force me to make a guess."]
