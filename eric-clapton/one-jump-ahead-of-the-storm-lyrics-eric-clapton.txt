["Lightning's flashing all around me,\nThunder's rolling up behind.\nBig blue clouds are going to roll in\nFull of tears and make me blind.", "I can't let her man recatch me.\nI can't stop to cry no more.\nI'm just running down the highway,\nOne jump ahead of the storm.", "One jump ahead of her crying,\nOne jump ahead of her cold cheating arm.\nOne jump ahead of her lying,\nOne jump ahead of the storm.", "One day I looked on the horizon,\nSaw her love just couldn't last.\nOh, my mind was torn to pieces.\nI had to leave and get out fast.", "And so I slipped out of her power.\nI saw my chance and I was gone\nBefore the rain could start to falling.\nOne jump ahead of the storm.", "Chorus", "I was one jump ahead of the storm.\nJust one jump ahead of the storm.\nI was one jump ahead of the storm.\nJust one jump ahead of the storm.", "I was one jump ahead of the storm.\nJust one jump ahead of the storm.\nI was one jump ahead of the storm.\nJust one jump ahead of the storm."]
