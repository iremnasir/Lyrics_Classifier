["by Eric Clapton", "My love has gone behind the sun;\nSince she left, the darkness has begun.\nThe smile that used to shine on me\nIs nothing more than a memory.", "I see her face, I hear her voice.\nShe made her move, I had no choice\nBut walk and cry, wipe tears with my hand,\nThe one that carries a wedding band.", "And the clouds hang low\nAnd the flowers that used to grow\nIn my heart\nAre dying now, dying now.", "Dying now."]
