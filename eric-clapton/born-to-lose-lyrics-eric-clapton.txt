["Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain\nEvery dream has only brought me pain\nAll my life I've always been so blue\nBorn to lose, and now I'm losing you", "Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear\nHow I long to always have you near\nYou've grown tired and now you say we're through\nBorn to lose, and now I'm losing you", "Born to lose, my every hope is gone\nIt's so hard to face each empty dawn\nYou were all the happiness I knew\nBorn to lose, and now I'm losing you\nBorn to lose, and now I'm losing you."]
