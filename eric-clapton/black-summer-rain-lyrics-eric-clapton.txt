["by Eric Clapton", "Where is the sun,\nThe sun that used to shine on me?\nWhere has it gone\nOr is it just a memory?", "I looked through the window,\nStaring at the sky,\nWaiting for a moment\nThat always passed me by.", "Black summer rain,\nBlack summer rain,\nBlack summer rain is falling on me, girl.", "Where is the love,\nThe love I need to set me free?\nAnd how can I escape\nThis gloom that is swallowing me?", "Chorus", "Chorus"]
