["by Chris Mosdell, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Michael Jackson", "All along, had to talk about it,\nLike a two-edged sword, he touched you and it stabs me.\nAll along, knew you were a phony girl,\nSit behind the mask where you control your world.", "Yesterday he had you in his arms;\nWhen I'm holding you, I feel his bitter charms.\nI can't judge what you do to me.\nCamoflage the truth, indulge your fantasy.", "Who do you love? Is it me now, is it him babe? I don't know.\nWho do you love? Is it me babe, is it him now? I don't know.", "There is nothing in your eyes; that's the way you cry.\nAll is grand, all is bright. You're just studying my mind.\nThere is nothing in your eyes; that's the way you cry.\nAll is grand, all is bright. You're just studying my mind.", "Was I invited to your masquerade?\nWell the party's over so now take off your face.\nYou say you love, but it's hard to see\nWhen you're in his arms, throwing rocks at me.", "Chorus", "I walk around suffering in my doom.\nWhen I come to you, you're sitting in your room.\nThe truth is news, I have longed to trace.\nSo take off the mask so I can see your face.", "Who do you love? Is it me baby, is it him now? I don't know.\nWho do you love? Is it me babe, is it him baby? I don't know.\nWho do you love? Is it me babe, is it him now? I don't know.\nWho do you love? Is it me now, is it him baby? I don't know.", "Who do you love? Is it me baby, is it him now? I don't know.\nWho do you love? Is it me baby, is it him now? I don't know.\nWho do you love? Is it me baby, is it him? I want to know.\nWho do you love?"]
