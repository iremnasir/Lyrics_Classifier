["Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high,\nThere's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.\nSomewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue,\nAnd the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.", "Someday I'll wish upon a star\nAnd wake up where the clouds are far behind me.\nWhere troubles melt like lemon drops,\nAway across the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me.", "Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.\nBirds fly over the rainbow, why then oh why can't I?", "[Chorus]", "Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.\nBirds fly over the rainbow, why then oh why can't I?\nBirds fly over the rainbow, why then oh why can't I?", "If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow,\nWhy oh why can't I?\nWhy can't I?\nWhy can't I?\nWhy can't I?"]
