["If the night turned cold and the stars looked down\nAnd you hug yourself on the cold cold ground.\nYou wake the morning in a stranger's coat,\nNo one would you see.\nYou ask yourself, who'd watch for me?\nMy only friend, who could it be?\nIt's hard to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me.", "When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real\nAnd you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal,\nYou search the city for your only friend,\nNo one would you see.\nYou ask yourself, who'd watch for me?\nA solitary voice to speak out and set me free.\nI hate to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me.", "You're not the easiest person I ever got to know\nAnd it's hard for us both to let our feelings show.\nSome would say I should let you go your way,\nYou'll only make me cry.\nBut if there's one guy, just one guy\nWho'd lay down his life for you and die,\nI hate to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me.", "When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense\nAnd there's only one voice that comes to your defense.\nThe jury's out and your eyes search the room\nAnd one friendly face is all you need to see.\nAnd if there's one guy, just one guy\nWho'd lay down his life for you and die,\nI hate to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me.", "I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me..."]
