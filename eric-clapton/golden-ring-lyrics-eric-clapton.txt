["He gave to you a golden ring\nIt made you happy, it made you sing\nAnd I played for you on my guitar\nIt didn't last long, it didn't go far", "And though the times have changed\nThey're rearranged\nWill the ties that bind remain the same?", "You came around after a while\nEveryone said that I made you smile\nIt all went well, and suddenly then\nYou heard that he would marry you again", "And though the times have changed\nThey're rearranged\nWill the ties that bind remain the same?", "Well, I know that I have been here before\nI've trod on your wings, I've opened the door\nIf I gave to you a golden ring\nWould I make you happy, would I make you sing?", "Though the times have changed\nThey're rearranged\nWill the ties that bind remain the same?", "Though the times have changed\nThey're rearranged\nWill the ties that bind remain the same?"]
