["by Eric Clapton, Greg Phillinganes and Bobby Columby", "Don't change your mind,\nI ain't got the time to sit and wonder.\nI'm doing fine.\nIf you decide to leave, I won't go under.", "You know I've come this far without you;\nIt won't be too hard to be alone.\nI've got choices all around me,\nSo I won't be spending too much time at home.", "Girl, I'm gonna miss you.\nI'm gonna miss you, baby.\nI can't forgive you,\nInstead I'm gonna miss you, baby.", "No, don't say a word.\nI already heard that you don't love me.\nIn your state of mind,\nI don't need to hear your side of the story.", "Your friends all said we had a future\nAnd I don't think I really want to know.\nMy friends keep telling me to lose you\nAnd how glad they'll be when you decide to go.", "Chorus", "I broke my back to make you happy.\nSometime, somehow, someone's got to care.\nIf you think you're better off without me,\nJust remember, it's a dirty world out there.", "Chorus", "I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,\nGonna miss the air you breathe.\nI'm just not quite happy, baby,\n'bout your crazy plans to leave."]
