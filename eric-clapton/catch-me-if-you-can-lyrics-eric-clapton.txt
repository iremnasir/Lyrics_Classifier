["by Eric Clapton and Gary Brooker", "Catch me if you can; I won't be easy to find.\nI got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind.\nCatch me if you can; it won't be easy to do.\nAnd I'm warning you brother I won't be leaving no clues.", "Catch me if you can; I won't be leaving no scent.\nI've been running the wrong way, I think it's time that I went.\nBelieve me, I'm a man; I ain't easy to tend.\nAnd I'm moving on out, so catch me if you can.", "There's no use bothering with the lost and found.\nYou'd better find a shovel, 'cause I've gone to ground.\nLittle girl never did pay me no mind.\nI guess I'll have to go and leave her behind. So . . .", "First Verse", "Chorus", "First Verse"]
