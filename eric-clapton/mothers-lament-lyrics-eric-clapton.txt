["Are we rolling? A one, a two, a three, a four", "A mother was washing her baby one night\nThe youngest of ten and a delicate mite\nThe mother was poor and the baby was thin\n'Twas naught but a skeleton covered with skin", "The mother turned 'round for a soap off the rack\nShe was only a moment but when she turned back\nHer baby had gone and in anguish she cried\n\"Oh, where has my baby gone?\" The angels replied", "Oh, your baby has gone down the plug hole\nOh, your baby has gone down the plug\nThe poor little thing was so skinny and thin\nHe should have been washed in a jug, in a jug", "Your baby is perfectly happy\nHe won't need a bath anymore\nHe's a-muckin' about with the angels above\nNot lost but gone before", "Do you want to do it again?"]
