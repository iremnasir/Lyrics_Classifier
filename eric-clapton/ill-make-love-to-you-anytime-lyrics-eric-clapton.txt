["by J. J. Cale", "Well I can't read and I can't write\nAnd I don't know my left from right.", "I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine\nAnd I don't know if you'll ever be mine,\nBut I'll make love to you any old time at all.", "I can't swim and I can't fly,\nI ain't no fish, ain't a bird in the sky.", "Chorus", "I can't count from one to ten,\nAnd I don't know the shape I'm in.", "Chorus"]
