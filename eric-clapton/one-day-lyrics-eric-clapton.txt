["One day\nI believe\nOne day\nI can see\nBaby\nOut in the country, maybe down by the sea\nWill I wake up one morning and find that I've been set free\nOne day\nOne day", "Some day\nI can't say how\nSome day\nBut I don't know now\nMaybe tomorrow when I'm old and gray\nWhat I ever wanted will finally come my way\nOne day\nOne day", "One day\nThis dream will come true\nOne day\nMaybe you will too\nMaybe flying high, maybe close to the ground\nI will hear your voice and I'll know I've been found\nHold me tight, baby make me stay\nI can hear every word you've been trying to say\nOne day\nOne day"]
