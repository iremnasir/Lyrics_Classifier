["by Eric Clapton and Simon Climie", "The point on the water, there's a change in the air,\nA vibe in the darkness but there's nobody there.\nI look for the reason but there's nothing to see,\nJust a hole in my memory where my mind used to be.", "Tell me why\nCan I find no relief in my heart.\nI reside\nIn a world that has fallen apart.", "Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby,\nShow me a way to get back on time, please.\nWhere do we go, baby, how will I know?\nWho holds the key, is it hidden inside of me?", "But why should I worry and why do I care\nWhen this road that I walk on is going nowhere.\nI stand and I study every face in the crowd,\nSee the fear in their eyes, they must be thinking out loud.", "Chorus", "Scratching the surface, it all looks the same;\nA world full of anger with no one to blame.\nBut who can I turn to? Who holds the key?\nAnd who has the answer? I think it's inside of me.", "Chorus", "Chorus", "All things considered it looks as though Utopia were far closer to us than\nanyone, only fifteen years ago, could have imagined. Then, I projected it six\nhundred years into the future. Today it seems quite possible that the horror\nmay be upon us within a single century. That is, if we refrain from blowing\nourselves to smithereens in the interval. Indeed, unless we choose to\ndecentralize and to use applied science, not as the end to which human beings\nare to be made the means, but as the means to producing a race of free\nindividuals, we have only two alternatives to choose from: either a number of\nnational militarized totalitarianisms, having as their root the terror of the\natomic bomb and as their consequence the destruction of civilization (or, if\nthe warfare is limited, the perpetuation of militarism); or else one\nsupranational totalitarianism, called into existence by the social chaos\nresulting from rapid technological progress in general and the atomic\nrevolution in particular, and developing, under the need for efficiency and\nstability, into the welfare-tyranny of Utopia. You pays your money and you\ntakes your choice.", "{The quote is the final paragraph of the foreward to Aldous Huxley's \"Brave\nNew World\", transcribed here in its entirety.}"]
