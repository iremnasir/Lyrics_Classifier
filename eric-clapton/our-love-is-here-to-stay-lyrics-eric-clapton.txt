["It's very clear\nOur love is here to stay\nNot for a year\nBut ever and a day", "The radio and the telephone\nAnd the movies that we know\nMay just be passing fancies,\nAnd in time may go", "But, oh my dear,\nOur love is here to stay\nTogether we're\nGoing a long, long way", "In time the Rockies may crumble,\nGibraltar may tumble,\nThey're only made of clay,\nBut our love is here to stay", "Oh my dear,\nOur love is here to stay\nTogether we're\nGoing a long, long way", "In time the Rockies may crumble,\nGibraltar may tumble,\nThey're only made of clay,\nBut our love is here to stay\nOur love is here to stay."]
