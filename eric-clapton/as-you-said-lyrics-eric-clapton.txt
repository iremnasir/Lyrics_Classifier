["By jack bruce and pete brown", "Let's go down to where it's clean\nTo see the time that might have been.\nThe tides have carried off the beach.\nAs you said,\nThe sun is out of reach.", "Let's go back to where it's clean\nTo see what year it might have been.\nThe roads have carried off the smiles.\nAs you said,\nTo judge them at the trials.", "Let's go back to now that's bad\nTo see the time we might have had.\nThe rails have carried off the trains.\nAs you said,\nI'll never come again, again, again, again."]
