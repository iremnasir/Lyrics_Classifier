["Cajun moon, where does your power lie\nAs you move across the southern sky\nYou took my babe way too soon\nWhat have you done, Cajun moon", "Someday babe, when you want your man\nAnd you find him gone, just like the wind\nDon't trouble your mind whatever you do\n'Cause Cajun moon took him from you", "Cajun moon, where does your power lie\nAs you move across the southern sky\nYou took my babe way too soon\nWhat have you done, Cajun moon", "When daylight fades, the night comes on\nYou can hear the silence of this song\nDon't trouble your mind whatever you do\n'Cause he got me like he got you", "Cajun moon, where does your power lie\nAs you move across the southern sky\nYou took my babe way too soon\nWhat have you done, Cajun moon"]
