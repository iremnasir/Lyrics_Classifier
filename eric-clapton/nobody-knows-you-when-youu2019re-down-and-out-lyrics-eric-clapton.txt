["Once I lived the life of a millionaire,\nSpent all my money, I just did not care.\nTook all my friends out for a good time,\nBought bootleg whiskey, champagne and wine.", "Then I began to fall so low,\nLost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go.\nI get my hands on a dollar again,\nI'm gonna hang on to it till that eagle grins.", "'Cause no, no, nobody knows you\nWhen you're down and out.\nIn your pocket, not one penny,\nAnd as for friends, you don't have any.", "When you finally get back up on your feet again,\nEverybody wants to be your old long-lost friend.\nSaid it's mighty strange, without a doubt,\nNobody knows you when you're down and out.", "When you finally get back upon your feet again,\nEverybody wants to be your good old long-lost friend.\nSaid it's mighty strange,\nNobody knows you,\nNobody knows you,\nNobody knows you when you're down and out."]
