["by Bonnie Bramlett and Eric Clapton", "I'm just a bad boy, long long ways from home.\nI'm just a bad boy, long long ways from home.\nBut I ain't got nobody to bury me when I'm dead and gone.", "Well I'm the cat that scratches and I'm like a dog that bites.\nI'll be your box of matches, baby, when you need a light.", "Chorus", "I used to have a little girl, only 16 years old,\nBut her mom and dad put me way out, way out in the cold.\nI can't stay here no longer, my luck is running slow.\nGotta keep on moving but I ain't got no place to go.", "Chorus"]
