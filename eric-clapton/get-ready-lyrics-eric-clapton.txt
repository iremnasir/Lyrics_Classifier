["by Eric Clapton and Yvonne Elliman", "Ready, get ready. Ready.\nHe's a man who's going to break your heart.\nReady, get ready. Ready.\nHe's a man who's going to break your heart.", "Well, you've been fooling 'round and I don't know why.\nLeft me on my own, sitting high and dry.\nBut I'm going to get you back, just you wait and see;\nYou can't do those things that you're doing to me.", "Chorus", "I've never needed a running 'round pissing hound,\nChecking out the bitches in heat.\nYou've got a lot of nerve, dishing out what you serve,\nWaggling your piece of meat.", "Chorus", "I want to get revenge on your sinful sins.\nI got to get you back for what you did back then.\nAnd now you've got it back, life is misery.\nWell, ha ha ha to you, ha ha to me.", "Ready, get ready. Ready.\nHe's the one that's going to break your heart.\nReady, get ready. Ready.\nHe's the one that's going to break your heart, break your heart,\nBreak your heart, break your heart.", "Get ready, get ready, get ready.\nHe's the one who's going to break your heart, break your heart,\nBreak your heart, break your heart,\nBreak your heart, break your heart,\nBreak your heart.", "Get ready, get ready, get ready.\n'Cause he's the one who's going to break your heart, break your heart,\nBreak your heart, break your heart."]
