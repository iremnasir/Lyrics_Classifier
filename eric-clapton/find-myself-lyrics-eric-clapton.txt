["We took the long way home, you held my hand,\nThe days so full of all the things we had planned.\nWe walked beyond the green, beyond the day.\nWe shared a dream that I let slip away.", "I had to find myself.\nI had to find myself.\nNo use looking for no one else,\n'Cause I'll be lonely till I find myself.", "You were the man who knew too much to say.\nSo many things that I learned came your way.\nThese things I know that I can't forget,\nDeep in my heart, they're a part of me yet.", "They helped me find myself.\nThey helped me find myself.\nNo use looking for no one else,\n'Cause I'll be lonely till I find myself.", "Too many years rolled by without a word.\nI tried to hide behind things that I'd heard.\nAnd now the truth is clear for all to see\nThat through it all, it was you believed in me.", "You helped me find myself.\nI had to find myself.\nNo use looking for no one else,\n'Cause I'll be lonely till I find myself.", "I got to find myself.\nI got to find myself.\nNo use looking for no one else,\n'Cause I'll be lonely till I find myself."]
