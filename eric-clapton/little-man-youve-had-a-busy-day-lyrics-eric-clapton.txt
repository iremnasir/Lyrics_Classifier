["Little man, you're cryin', I know why you're blue\nSomeone took your kiddy-car away\nYou better go to sleep now\nLittle man, you've had a busy day", "Johnny won your marbles, tell you what we'll do\nDad'll get you new ones right away\nTime to go to sleep now\nLittle man, you've had a busy day", "Put away your soldiers, the battle has been won\nThe enemy is out of sight\nCome along there soldier, put away your gun\nThe war is over for tonight", "Time to stop your schemin', time your day was through\nListen what the jukebox softly say\nTime to go to sleep now\nLittle man, you've had a busy day", "Time to stop your schemin', time your day was through\nListen what the jukebox softly say\nTime to go to sleep now\nLittle man, you've had a busy day\nTime to go to sleep now\nLittle man, you've had a busy day"]
