["Georgia, Georgia,\nThe whole day through\nJust an old sweet song\nKeeps Georgia on my mind", "I say Georgia\nGeorgia\nA song of you\nComes as sweet and clear\nAs moonlight through the pines", "Other arms reach out to me\nOther eyes smile tenderly\nStill in peaceful dreams I see\nThe road leads back to you", "I said Georgia,\nOoh Georgia, no peace I find, yeah\nIt's just an old sweet song\nKeeps Georgia on my mind", "Other arms reach out to me\nOther eyes smile tenderly\nStill in peaceful dreams I see\nThe road leads back to you", "Georgia,\nOh, Georgia,\nNo peace I find\nIt' just an old, sweet song\nKeeps Georgia on my mind", "It' just an old, sweet song\nKeeps Georgia on my mind."]
