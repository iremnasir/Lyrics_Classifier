["I'm driftin' and driftin', just like a ship out on the sea\nI'm driftin' and driftin', just like a ship out on the sea\nWell I ain't got nobody, in this world to care for me", "If my baby, would only take me back again\nIf my baby, would only take me back again\nI would feel much better darling, and at least I'd have a friend", "I give you all my money, tell me what more can I do\nI give you all my money, tell me what more can I do\nYou is a sweet little girl, but I swear you won't be true", "I'm driftin' and driftin', just like a ship out on the sea\nI'm driftin' and driftin', just like a ship out on the sea\nBecause I ain't got nobody, in this world to care for me"]
