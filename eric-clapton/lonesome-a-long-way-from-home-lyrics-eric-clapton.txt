["(by bonnie bramlett and leon russell)", "Out on an open highway,\nSuch a lovely day but something's wrong.\nSomething, something's gotta be wrong.", "I just left home this morning,\nThis old road keeps rolling on and on.\nRolling, rolling on and on.", "Won't somebody help me?\nWon't somebody help me?\nWon't somebody help me?\nI've never been so lonesome and long way from home,\nNever been lonesome and long way,\nNever been lonesome and long way from home.", "Chorus"]
