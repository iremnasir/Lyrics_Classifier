["All of me, why not take all of me?\nCan't you see I'm no good without you?\nTake my lips, I wanna lose them\nTake my arms, I never use them", "Your goodbyes they left me with eyes that cry\nHow can I get along without you?\nYou took the part that once was my heart\nSo why not take all of me?", "Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry\nNow I am lost without you\nAnd now that you took that part that used to be my heart", "All of me, why not take all of me?\nCan't you see I'm a mess without you?\nYou took the part that used to be my heart\nSo why not take all of me?"]
