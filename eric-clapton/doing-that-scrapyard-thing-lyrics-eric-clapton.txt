["By jack bruce and pete brown", "When I was young they gave me a mongrel piano,\nSpent all my time inventing the cup of tea.\nWriting your name in the sea,\nBanging my favorite head.", "Missing the last bed, waving the cheery herring,\nBalancing brass bands on the tip of my toe.\nPhoning your home from a tree,\nDrinking my favorite loch.", "When I was old they gave me a model factory,\nI met three salads out on the motorway.\nLeaving your name at the door,\nBreaking my favorite egg.", "Missing the walrus, sharing my last banana,\nBalancing zeppelins on the end of my nose.\nCalling your name in the zoo,\nBlowing my favorite mind."]
