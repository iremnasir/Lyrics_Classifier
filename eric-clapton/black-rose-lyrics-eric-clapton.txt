["The dogs are howlin' at the midnight moon\nI'm on my way to where the black rose blooms\nThe mountain's high, the night is cold\nI feel the sunshine, a black rose grows", "Together again, we're as common as sin, they say\nWe just walk around the stones they throw\nNight after night, we steal away to where\nLove don't see no colors in the shadows\nA love don't see no colors in the shadows", "Wind in the willows, wild and warm\nJust like the woman lyin' here in my arms\nWater's deep, cold and still\nI love the feelin' that the black rose gives", "Together again, we're as common as sin, they say\nWe just walk around the stones they throw\nNight after night, we steal away to where\nLove don't see no colors in the shadows\nLove don't see no colors in the shadows", "Together again, we're as common as sin, they say\nWe just walk around the stones they throw\nNight after night, we steal away to where\nLove don't see no colors in the shadows\nLove don't see no colors in the shadows\nLove don't see no colors in the shadows"]
