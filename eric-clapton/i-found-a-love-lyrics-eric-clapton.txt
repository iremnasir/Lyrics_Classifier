["by Wilson Pickett, Robert West, and Willie Schofield", "What would you do if I told you that I'm falling in love again?\nI found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands\nA way to make my heart beat faster.\nIs this heaven we're living in?\nA way to make my life worth living.\nI've fallen in love again.", "I've got to ask you now, baby:", "What would you say if I told you that I'm falling in love again?\nI found a love that will hold my hand and baby she understands\nA way to make my heart beat faster.\nIs this heaven we're living in?\nA way to make my life worth living.\nI've fallen in love again.", "Second Verse"]
