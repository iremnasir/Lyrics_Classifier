["Sneaking kisses in the hall\nParting love notes are on the wall\nBeen each other's all and all each day\nLovers walking in the rain\nSo close we felt each other's pain\nBut now you say that love has died away\n'Cause we've ended now as lovers\nDoesn't mean that we each other can't be friends\n'Cause we've ended now as lovers\nDoes our love for one another have to end\nI remember teaching you", "On piano 'Tea for Two'\nAnd how playing it wrong I kissed your hand\nBut when our love has gone and passed\nWhy does the good exceed the bad\nWell that's one thing I'll never understand\n'Cause I remember us at class\nYou were always the one to pass\nAnd gave me answers right to see me through\nBut that was more than years ago\nAnd who will love me I don't know\nIt's sad for sure but true it won't be you"]
