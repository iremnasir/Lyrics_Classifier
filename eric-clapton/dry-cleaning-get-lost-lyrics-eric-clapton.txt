["I'm sorry.\nWhy should I say I'm sorry?\nIf I hurt you,\nYou know you've hurt me too.", "But you get lost inside your tears,\nAnd there is nothing I can do,\n'Cause I get lost inside my fear\nThat I am nothing without you.", "You're angry.\nWhy shouldn't you be angry?\nWith what we've been through,\nWell I get angry too.", "But you get lost inside your tears,\nAnd there is nothing I can do,\n'Cause I get lost inside my fear\nThat I am nothing without you."]
