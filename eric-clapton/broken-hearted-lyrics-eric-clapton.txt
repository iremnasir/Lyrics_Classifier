["by Eric Clapton and Greg Phillinganes", "When the wind blows down this hard,\nMany a bond is broken.\nSee the water lie on the ground\nFrom where the heavens opened.", "Lord, how will you get through this night\nWith your dreams departed?\nAnd who alone will comfort you?\nOnly the broken hearted.", "So you've gone beyond your means,\nEvery wound is open,\nYour best laid plans are out of reach,\nAnd all your fears unspoken.", "Chorus", "Sweet revenge is spoken then;\nIn the twilight it is gone.\nTo living lies with no escape,\nLord, I would rather be alone.", "I press my fingers to the wood\nTo tell you of my dreaming,\nTo sing you songs from olden times,\nTo keep the love light gleaming.", "'Cause there's a place where we can go,\nWhere we will not be parted.\nAnd who alone will enter there?\nOnly the broken hearted.", "Only the broken, broken hearted.\nOnly the broken, broken hearted.\nOnly the broken, broken hearted.\nOnly the broken, broken hearted."]
