["And how do I choose and where do I draw the line,\nBetween truth and necessary pain?\nAnd how do I know and where do I get my belief,\nThat things will be all right again?\nWhat words do I use to try and explain,\nTo those who have witnessed all my tears?\nAnd what does it mean to know all these things,\nWhen love's been wasted all these years\nWhen love's been wasted all these years", "Standing in the shadows\nWith my heart right in my hand\nRemoved from other people\nWho could never understand\nI was a pilgrim for your love\nA pilgrim for your love\nA pilgrim for your love\nI was a pilgrim for your love", "Its like living in a nightmare\nlike looking in a blackest hole\nlike standing on the edge of nothing\ncompletely out of control\nNow where have I been all these years\nand how come I just couldn't see\nlike a blind man walking 'round in darkness\nI was a pilgrim for your love\nI was a pilgrim for your love", "standing in the shadows with my heart right in my hand\nremoved from other people who could never understand\nstanding in the shadows with my heart right in my hand\nremoved from other people who could never understand\nI was a pilgrim for your love\na pilgrim for your love...\nI was a pilgrim for your love\na pilgrim for your love...\nI was a pilgrim for your love\na pilgrim for your love..."]
