["(by Otis Rush)", "Lay awake at night,\nOh so low, just so troubled.\nCan't get a job,\nLaid off and I'm having double trouble.", "Hey hey, to make you've got to try.\nBaby, that's no lie.\nSome of this generation is millionaires;\nI can't even keep decent clothes to wear.", "Laugh at me walking,\nAnd I have no place to go.\nBad luck and trouble has taken me;\nI have no money to show.", "Chorus"]
