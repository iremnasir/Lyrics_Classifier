["(Chorus:)\nIt's too late, she's gone.\nIt's too late, my baby's gone.\nWish I had told her she was my only one.\nIt's too late, she's gone.", "It's a woman that cries,\nSo I guess I've gotta hide my eyes.\nYes, I will miss her more than anyone.\nIt's too late, she's gone.", "She's gone, yes she's gone.\nShe's gone, my baby's gone.\nShe's gone, yes she's gone.\nWhere can my baby be?", "And I wonder does she know\nWhen she left me, it hurt me so.\nI need your love babe, please don't make me wait.\nTell me it's not too late.", "(Chorus)", "(Repeat Third Verse)"]
