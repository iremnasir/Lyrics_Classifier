["Gonna build myself a castle\nHigh up in the clouds\nThere'll be skies outside my window\nLose these streets and crowds\nDance the night away", "Will find myself an ocean\nSail into the blue\nLive with golden swordfish\nForget the time of you\nDance the night away", "Dance myself to nothing\nVanish from this place\nGonna turn myself to shadow\nSo I can't see your face\nDance the night away"]
