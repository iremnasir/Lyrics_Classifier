["The rain is falling through the mist of sorrow that surrounded me\nThe sun could never thaw away the the bliss that lays around me", "Let it rain, let it rain\nLet your love rain down on me\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, rain, rain", "Her life was like a desert flower burning in the sun\nUntil I found the way to love, it's harder said than done", "Let it rain, let it rain\nLet your love rain down on me\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, rain, rain", "Now I know the secret, there is nothing that I lack\nIf I give my love to you, you'll surely give it back", "Let it rain, let it rain\nLet your love rain down on me\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, rain, rain", "Let it rain, let it rain\nLet your love rain down on me\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, rain, rain"]
