["(Robert Johnson)", "Early this morning,\nYou knocked upon my door,\nEarly this morning,\nYou knocked upon my door,\nAnd I said, \"Hello, Satan,\nI believe it's time to go.\"", "Me and the devil\nWere walking side by side.\nMe and the devil\nWere walking side by side.\nI'm gonna beat my woman\nUntil I get satisfied.", "She said she don't see why,\nThat I will dog her 'round.\n(Now baby, you know you ain't doing me right.)\nShe said she don't see why, That I will dog her 'round.\nWell, it must be that old evil spirit\nSo deep down in the ground.", "You may bury my body\nDown by the highway side.\n(I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone.)\nYou may bury my body\nDown by the highway side.\nOh, my old evil spirit\nCan take a Greyhound bus and ride."]
