["by Eric Clapton", "High upon a mountain top\nWhere the eagle builds his nest\nI shall go wandering,\nTrying to put my mind at rest,\nAnd I shall never cease\nUntil the day I die.", "He was once a friend of mine,\nBut I did not know or care\nUntil she said goodbye.\nI cried till I could hardly see\nThe meaning of my life.\nWhat do I do now?", "First Verse"]
