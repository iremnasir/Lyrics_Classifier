["The moment's come and gone\nEvery memory leaves a trace\nAll that I've come to know\nIn the lines upon my face", "Every storm that I have turned\nEach forgiveness I have earned\nEvery shame that's taught me grace\nFrom you I have learned", "No love is lost\nNo love is lost", "That everything is shown to me\nI let it wash over me\nLike diamonds made of rain\nYou can find joy inside the pain", "Everything that I've endured\nFor the wisdom of a pearl\nI wouldn't change a thing\nYou can make diamonds from the rain", "Every mile of this road\nEvery chord that's struck my soul\nYou are the melody\nThat will soothe me 'til I'm old", "If the promises are kept\nI'll waive all of my regrets\nI can say I've overcome\nWith you, my heart is open", "No love was lost\nNo love was lost", "That everything is shown to me\nI let it wash over me\nLike diamonds made of rain\nYou can find joy inside the pain", "Everything that I've endured\nFor the wisdom of a pearl\nI wouldn't change a thing\nYou can make diamonds from the rain"]
