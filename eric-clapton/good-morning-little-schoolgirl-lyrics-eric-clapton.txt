["by H. G. Demarais", "Good morning, little schoolgirl.\nGood morning, little schoolgirl.\nCan I go home with you?\nWon't you let me go home with you,\nSo I can hug, hug, squeeze, squeeze?\nIf you let me I can tease you baby.\nHey, hey hey hey. Hey hey hey hey. Hey, yeah.", "Let's dance, little schoolgirl.\nLet's dance, little schoolgirl.\nWon't you let me take you to the hop, hop,\nHave a party at the soda shop\nSo we can do the twist, do the stroll\nTo the music of the rock 'n' roll.\nHey, hey hey hey. Hey hey hey hey. Hey, yeah.", "First Verse", "Good morning, little schoolgirl.\nGood morning, little schoolgirl.\nCan I go home with you?\nWon't you let me go home with you?\nTell your mama and your papa that I love you.\nTell your sisters and your brother that I love you.\nHey, hey hey hey. Hey, hey hey hey.\nHey, hey hey hey. Hey, hey hey hey."]
