["There is nothing that is wrong\nIn wanting you to stay here with me\nI know you've got somewhere to go\nBut won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?\nAnd don't you ever leave", "Lay down, Sally and rest here in my arms\nDon't you think you want someone to talk to?\nLay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon\nI've been trying all night long just to talk to you", "Sun ain't nearly on the rise\nWe still got the moon and stars above\nUnderneath the velvet skies love is all that matters\nWon't you stay with me? Don't you ever leave", "Lay down, Sally and rest here in my arms\nDon't you think you want someone to talk to?\nLay down, Sally and no need to leave so soon\nI've been trying all night long just to talk to you", "I long to see the morning light\nColoring your face so dreamily\nSo don't you go and say goodbye\nYou can lay your worries down and stay with me\nDon't you ever leave", "Lay down, Sally and rest here in my arms\nDon't you think you want someone to talk to?\nLay down, Sally there's no need to leave so soon\nI've been trying all night long just to talk to you\nLay down, Sally and rest here in my arms\nBut don't you think you want someone to talk to?\nLay down, Sally there's no need to leave so soon\nI've been trying all night long just to talk to you"]
