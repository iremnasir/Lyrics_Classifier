["Tossin & turning all night long\nDown in my pillow felt so strong\nI had to get up and write this song\nTell me, where do we go from here", "I'd give anything to make you see\nYour brand of lovin were made for me\nWhat can I do to make you see\nthat with you I can't go wrong", "All I do is pray\nThat you would come my way\nNo doubt about it, I've got a one track mind", "You took my breathe so easily\nAnd you touched my heart so carefully\nAnd you give your love so tenderly\nAnd you can't do nothin' wrong", "Cause I got not time for no one else\nAnd I got no love for no one else\nCause I don't believe in no one else\nWith you I do belong", "chorus\nAs far as I can see, (as far as I can see) the only one for me\nNo doubt about it, I've got a one track mind\nAs far as I can see, (as far as I can see) the only one for me\nNo doubt about it, I've got a one track mind", "You take my breathe so easily\nYou touched my heart so carefully\nYou give your love so crazily\nYou can't do nothin' wrong", "Chorus repeats"]
