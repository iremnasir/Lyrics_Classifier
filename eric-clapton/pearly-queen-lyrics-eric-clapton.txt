["by Steve Winwood and Jim Capaldi", "I had a strange dream from a pearly queen,\nAnd she could drink more wine than I've ever seen.\nShe had some gypsy's blood flowing through her feet,\nAnd when the time was right she said that I would meet\nMy destiny.", "I traveled 'round the world to find the sun.\nI couldn't stop myself from having fun,\nBut when the time was right, the flowers grew\nBut they were made of silk and sequins, two by two.", "I traveled 'round the world to find the sun.\nI couldn't stop myself from having fun.\nBut when the time was right, the flowers grew\nBut they were made of silk and sequins, I would meet\nMy destiny."]
