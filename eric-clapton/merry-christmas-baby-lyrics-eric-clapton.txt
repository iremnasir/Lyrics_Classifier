["Merry Christmas baby\nYou sure do treat me nice\nMerry Christmas baby\nYou sure do treat me nice\nBought me a high five of Christmas\nNow I'm living in paradise", "I'm feelin' mighty fine\nI've got music on my radio\nFeelin' mighty fine\nGot good music on my radio\nI wanna hug and kiss you\nUnderneath the mistletoe", "Santa came down the chimney\nAt half past three\nLeft all his presents\nHere for you and me", "Merry Christmas baby\nYou sure been good to me\nYou know I love you baby\nAnd I'm happy as a man can be"]
