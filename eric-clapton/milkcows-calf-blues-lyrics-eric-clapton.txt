["(Robert Johnson)", "Tell me, milk cow,\nWhat on Earth is wrong with you?\nOh, milk cow,\nWhat on Earth is wrong with you?\nNow, you've left you a calf\nAnd your milk is turning blue.", "Lord, your calf is hungry\nAnd I believe he needs a suck.\nLord, your calf is hungry,\nI believe he needs a suck.\nWell, your milk is turning blue.\nI believe he's out of luck.", "\nNow, I feel like milking and my cow won't come.\nI feel like churning and my milk won't turn.\nI'm cryin' please,\nPlease, don't do me wrong.\nIf you see my milk cow, baby now,\nPlease drive her home.", "Lord, my milk cow been rambling\nFor miles around.\nLord, my milk cow been rambling\nFor miles around.\nWell, how can you suck on some other man's bull cow\nIn this strange man's town?"]
