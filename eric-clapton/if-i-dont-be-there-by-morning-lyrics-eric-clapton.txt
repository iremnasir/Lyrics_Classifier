["by Bob Dylan and Helena Springs", "Blue sky upon the horizon,\nPrivate eye is on my trail,\nAnd if I don't be there by morning\nYou know that I must have spent the night in jail.", "I've been running from Memphis to L. A.\nHad an appointment set sometime for today,\nAnd if I don't be there by morning\nYou know that I must have gone the other way.", "Finding my way back to you girl,\nLonely and blue and mistreated too.\nSometimes I think of you girl,\nIs it true that you think of me too?", "I got a woman living in L. A.\nI got a woman waiting for my pay,\nAnd if I don't be there by morning,\nPack my clothes, get down on your knees and pray.", "Chorus", "I left my woman with a twenty dollar bill.\nI left her waiting, I hope she's waiting for me still.\nIf I don't be there by morning\nYou know that I, I never will."]
