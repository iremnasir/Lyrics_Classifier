["Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you\nYou take my heart into everything you do\nAnd it makes me sad for the lonely people\nI walked that road for so long\nNow I know that I'm one of the lucky people\nYour love is making me strong", "I've had enough bad love\nI need something I can be proud of\nI've had enough bad love\nNo more bad love", "And now I see that my life has been so blue\nWith all the heartaches I had till I met you\nBut I'm glad to say now that's all behind me\nWith you here by my side\nAnd there's no more memories to remind me\nYour love will keep me alive", "I've had enough bad love\nI need something I can be proud of\nI've had enough bad love\nNo more bad love\nSolo"]
