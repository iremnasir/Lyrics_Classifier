["Back Home Lyrics", "I've been on the road too long\nMoving in the wrong direction\nI don't know where I belong\nI don't know what I will do, if I can't get back home\nTroubles I've got on my own\nThey don't fit no other person\nMemories keep rollin' on\nI don't know what I will do, if I can't get back home", "I don't fit, but I don't give a damn\nI won't quit, cause I know who I am\nAnd I'll admit that I've been on the lam", "Bit by bit, I'll review my plan\nThis is it, do the best I can\nTrust and understand", "'Cause that I know I'm loved\nI'll be on my way\nGot no need to stay 'round here\n'Cause I been on this road too long\nGoing in the wrong direction\nAnd I don't know where I come from\nAll I know is I will die, if I don't get back home"]
